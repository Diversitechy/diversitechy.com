    <h2>Community Code of Conduct</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Last updated July 24, 2018.</p>
      <p>Everyone participating in the Diversitechy community - including, but not limited to Diversitechy events and its Slack channel - is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes all attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and staff.</p>
      <p>Diversitechy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
      <p>Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Diversitechy organizers.</p>
